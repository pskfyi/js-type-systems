features:
- title: Centralized Runtime Type Checking
  details: No more one-off type checking utility functions. Between JS.typeof and helpers like .isBoolean for all types, you're covered!
- title: (De)Serialize Anything
  details: The Json subtype describes the encodable types. Each JS type points to a Json subtype and defines serialization and deserialization functions.
- title: Subtyping and Composite Typing
  details: Object types like Array are labeled subtypes of Object. Create your own subtypes as restricted versions of JS types.
