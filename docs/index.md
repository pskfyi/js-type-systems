- title: Centralized Runtime Type Checking
  details: No more one-off type checking utility functions. The JS type system's .typeof and helpers have got you covered!
- title: (De)Serialize Anything
  details: The Json type system describes the encodable types. Each JS type points to a Json subtype and defines serialization and deserialization functions.
- title: Subtyping and Composite Typing
  details: Object types like Array are labeled subtypes of Object. Create your own subtypes as restricted versions of JS types.
